## Binary Search Tree Project

This project implements a simple **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in Python.  
It demonstrates basic operations like inserting nodes, searching for values, deleting nodes , performing an inorder traversal, and to find min value.

## Features
- Insert new nodes into the tree
- Search for a specific value
- Delete nodes from tree
- Display the tree using inorder traversal
- Find minimum value

## How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed.

In your terminal, navigate to the project folder and run:

python Binary_Search_Tree.py

**Environment**
Python 3.13.3
VS Code (recommended)

**Sample Output**
Search for 80: 80
Inorder traversal: [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
Search for 40: None

**About**
This is a practice project to demonstrate understanding of basic data structures, created as part of my Python learning journey.
